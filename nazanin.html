            <p>  <h2>Carnival masks</h2> 
                Masks have always been an important feature of the Venetian carnival. Traditionally people were allowed to wear <br>
                them between the festival of Santo Stefano (St. Stephen's Day, December 26) and the end of the carnival season <br>
                at midnight of Shrove Tuesday (movable, but during February or early March). As masks were also allowed on <br>
                Ascension and from October 5 to Christmas, people could spend a large portion of the year in disguise. <br>
                Maskmakers (mascherari) enjoyed a special position in society, with their own laws and their own guild, with their <br>
                own statute dated 10 April 1436. Mascherari belonged to the fringe of painters and were helped in their task by <br>
                sign-painters who drew faces onto plaster in a range of different shapes and paying extreme attention to detail. <br>
                Venetian masks can be made of leather or porcelain, or by using the original glass technique. The original masks <br>
                were rather simple in design, decoration, and often had a symbolic and practical function. Nowadays, most Italian <br>
                masks are made with the application of gesso and gold leaf and are hand-painted using natural feathers and gems <br>
                to decorate.
        
                <h2>Origin</h2>
                There is less evidence explaining the motive for the earliest mask being worn in Venice. <br>
                One scholar argues that covering the face in public was a uniquely Venetian response to  <br>
                one of the most rigid class hierarchies in European history. <br>
                During Carnival, the sumptuary laws were suspended, and people could dress as they liked, <br>
                 instead of according to the rules that were set down in law for their profession and social class. <br>
        
                <h2>Colombina</h2>
                The Colombina (also known as Columbine and as a Colombino) is a half-mask, only covering the wearer's eyes, nose, and upper cheeks. <br>
                It is often highly decorated with gold, silver, crystals, and feathers. <br>
                It is held up to the face by a baton or is tied with ribbon as with most other Venetian masks.  <br>
                The Colombina mask is named after a stock character in the Commedia dell'arte: <br>
                Colombina was a maidservant and soubrette who was an adored part of the Italian theatre for generations. <br>
                 It is said it was designed for an actress because she did not wish to have her beautiful face covered completely. <br>
                 In fact, the Colombina is entirely a modern creation. <br>
                  There are no historic paintings depicting its use on the stage or in social life. <br>
                  While both men and women now wear this mask, it began as a woman's analog to the bauta.
        
                  <h2>Bauta</h2>
                  The bauta (sometimes referred as baùtta) is a mask, today often heavily gilded though originally simple stark white, <br>
                   which is designed to comfortably cover the entire face; <br>
                   this traditional grotesque piece of art was characterized by the inclusion of an over-prominent nose, <br>
                    a thick supraorbital ridge, a projecting "chin line" <br>
                    , and no mouth. The mask's beak-like chin is designed to enable the wearer to talk, <br>
                    eat, and drink without having to remove it, thereby preserving the wearer's anonymity. <br>
                     The bauta was often accompanied by a red or black cape and a tricorn.
        
                  <h2>Medico Della Peste (The Plague Doctor)</h2>
                  The Medico della peste, with its long beak, is one of the most bizarre and recognizable of the Venetian masks, <br>
                  though it did not start out as carnival mask at all but as a method of preventing the spread of disease. <br>
                  The striking design originates from 17th-century French physician Charles de Lorme who adopted the mask together with other sanitary precautions while treating plague victims. <br>
                  The mask is often white, consisting of a hollow beak and round eyeholes covered with crystal discs, creating a bespectacled effect. <br>
                  Its use as a carnival mask is entirely a modern convention, and today these masks are often much more decorative. <br>
                  Although the mask and costume is worn almost exclusively by males, <br>
                  the enhancement in decoration also suggests that women are now more likely to wear the mask and costume than in previous years at the Carnival. <br>
